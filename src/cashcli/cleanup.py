"""Automatic removal of data that only concerns months before the current one.

Runs before every command that opens the database (disable with --no-cleanup). Rules:
- a one-off flow dated before the current month is removed;
- a flow whose last occurrence (until, or COUNT) is before the current month is removed;
- a debt that is paid off before the current month is removed (with its payment flow);
- a debt whose balance date is before the current month is rolled forward: its balance becomes
  the simulated balance at the end of the previous month, and events before that are dropped;
- tags no longer used by any flow are removed.
